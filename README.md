```
sudo apt-get update     
sudo apt-get install git    
cd /home/${USER}/       
git clone https://github.com/shivasiddharth/PulseAudio-System-Wide       
cd ./PulseAudio-System-Wide/      
sudo cp ./pulseaudio.service /etc/systemd/system/pulseaudio.service    
systemctl --system enable pulseaudio.service       
systemctl --system start pulseaudio.service       
sudo cp ./client.conf /etc/pulse/client.conf        
sudo sed -i '/^pulse-access:/ s/$/root,pi/' /etc/group
